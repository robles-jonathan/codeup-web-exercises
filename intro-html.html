        <h1>Let's sing a silly song:</h1>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay</p>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay</p>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-ee-ay-ee-lee-ay</p>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay</p>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay</p>
        <p>Ho-la-la-ee-ay-ee-la-lee-ay-lee-o-lee-ay</p>
        <p>I'd like to dance and tap my feet</p>
        <p>But they won't keep in rhythm</p>
        <p>You see, I washed them both today</p>
        <p>And I can't do nothing with 'em</p>
        <p>Ho hum the tune is dumb</p>
        <p>The words don't mean a thing</p>
        <p>Isn't this a silly song</p>
        <p>For anyone to sing?</p>
        <p>I chased a polecat up a tree</p>
        <p>Way out on upon a limb</p>
        <p>And when he got the best of me</p>
        <p>I got the worst of him</p>
        <p>(Yodel, etc.)</p>
