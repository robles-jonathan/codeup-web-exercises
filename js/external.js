// Exercises
console.log("Hello from External JavaScript");

// Exercise 1 Use the alert function to show a message that says 'Welcome to my Website!'.
var alertWelcome = alert("Welcome to my website!");

// Exercise 2 Use a prompt to ask for the user's favorite color. Use the user's response to alert a message that says that the color entered is your favorite color too.
// For example, if the user enters "blue", your code should alert a message that says:
// "Great, blue is my favorite color too!"

var favoriteColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?");
alert("Great, " + favoriteColor + " is my favorite color too!!");


//Exercise 3 Complete exercise 3 from the previous lesson, but write your code in the external.js file instead of in the console.
// When the exercise asks you to use a number, instead use a prompt to ask the user for that number.
// Use an alert to show the results of each problem.

//Write some JavaScript code, that is, variables and operators, to describe the following scenarios. Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, the goal of these exercises is to understand how real world conditions can be represented with code.

// You have rented some movies for your kids:
// The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it).

// Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350.
